# Karabiner Elements Configuration
Configuration files for my Karabiner Elements at `~/.config/karabiner`.

### Installation
1. ([Repo](https://github.com/pqrs-org/Karabiner-Elements)) Homebrew: `brew install --cask karabiner-elements`
2. Go to `~/.config/karabiner` and clone this repo.

### Current Configs
Profiles: Qwerty, Engram (Affects all keyboards)

Added shortcuts for Keychron K6:
> Note, you cannot overwrite fn1 key as this is exclusive to the keyboard. As such, after rearranging your keys to Engram layout, the Bluetooth buttons will remain on `QWE -> BYO` and the `insert`, `del`, and `end` keys remain on `P[] -> VZ/`.
- Fix `Command + ~` and `Command + Shift + ~` for K6 (switch window of same application.)
- `Control + Esc` to write `Tilde (~)`.
- `Shift + Esc` to write `Grave (``)`.
- `Home` to Show Desktop.
- `Page Up` to use Mission Control.
- `Page Down` to use Spotlight.
- `Control + Home` to Launch/Show/Minimise iTerm2.
